# Fun_with_words
The code for this task is on Github, and the demo is pulling the code directly from the most current release there:
  https://github.com/ljohnson425/Fun_with_words

You can see this in action here: https://dom.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_didJZP14WPlvKPX

The easiest way to get started is to import this qualtrics survey which shows the task
   https://github.com/ljohnson425/Fun_with_words/blob/master/Qualtrics_Word_Search_Task_-_Demo.qsf
(click "raw" then download the file and then import it into your Qualtrics account)

Details on how to use the task are embedded directly in the templates:
* In custom headers, you set Qualtrics to point to the needed javascript
* In each question you set some html and custom javascript
* You can edit the scripts themsevles to change functionality, etc.  

It can seem a bit intimidating at first, but should be doable with a bit of work.

I will be updating this github project as needed. If you want to complete a project and know that absoultely nothing
will change without you knowing it, fork this project and then set your qualtrics surveys to point to the fork.

And, as always, consider pre-registering your experiment and analysis plan, sharing your data and analysis script, being complete and transparent in how you report your results, and publishing in accessible repository no matter what the results.
